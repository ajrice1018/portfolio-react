Over the course of six months I observed Andy's natural aptitude for programming and making things work. For group projects, not only was he able to go above and beyond the requirements but he was able to assist his teammates as well which made them stronger coders and fostered positive team morale and results. I'm looking forward to working with Andy as he begins honing his skills as a teaching assistant for our program this summer and thoroughly recommend him for a web development role for those hiring managers that require a solid junior level engineer.",

He was always prepared for class, caught up on the material, and it was clear that he spent many hours each week outside of class practicing his code and learning how to improve his skills. He was also helpful in explaining topics that others, including myself, found confusing and he was a pleasant and dependable person to work with.",

Throughout the class, Andy pushed himself to succeed by putting in 20+ hours of self-study outside of class every week, impressing myself, our peers, and our instructors. Andy is also a great team player and communicator. During our first project, Andy took the lead by making sure we were staying on top of our deliverables and reviewing our code. Andy is a quick learner, a great developer, and simply a good person. He would be a great addition to any team.",

He was the creative genius behind the main idea of our Musrch project. He excelled in being a team leader but also kept the playing field level for all group members. Andy shared his knowledge with everyone in the group, as well as providing additional examples during class time. He is laid back, yet punctual. His willingness to explain difficult concepts and share code with everyone was was inspiring.",
